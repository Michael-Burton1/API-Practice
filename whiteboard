A. I need to create a function that takes an input( their age on earth) from the user and returns their age on different planets.

  I need to 
  1. create an obect of someone's age on earth.
  2. create differnt funtions to take that age and calculate their age (a differnt function for each planet) on Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter.
  3. return the calculated age to the user.

B. I then I need to:
  1.create values for "life expectancy" for earth  
  2. compare that to users inputted age (converted for each planet) to determine how long they have left to live on each planet
  3. return a message alerting user how long they have to live. 
  4. return a message  alerting user how long they have lived over life expectancy.

  EASY!
